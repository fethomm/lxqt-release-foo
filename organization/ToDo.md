# Preparation

## Code

* [ ] Should we introduce some kind of freeze roughly similar to the common practice of Debian before they publish another stable release?   
  Developers could be encouraged to refrain from major changes and push minor fixes only for a while. Intended to avoid problems like
  https://github.com/lxde/lxqt/issues/1106 which took place shortly before release 0.11 should be published (besides this one ended well, of course).

## Release archives

* [ ] Signing: Establish a project PGP key instead of the keys of distinct developers used so far. Have it signed by all LXQt team members.
* [ ] Should we (automatically) build the components using the release archives as kind of check? On which platform (probably Arch Linux for the ease
  of handling)?

## Documentation

* [ ] reviewing: Should we try to establish some kind of pool of reviewers? Could be good if the single person who kindly reviewed so far isn't available.

# Release itself

## Publish release announcements

Currently we publish a somewhat more verbose announcement on lxqt.org and hint to it on the ML (probably in a forum as well soon). Also, a Subreddit exists. Both seems all right.
* [ ] Are there other institutions we may want to inform in the future?
